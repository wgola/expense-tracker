## üíª Running the app locally

There are two possibilities of running the app:

- running both the app and functionality providers inside containers
- running the app in development mode using `pnpm run dev` and functionality providers inside containers with Docker

For both options see guide below üí°

### Running locally with Docker and Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the app locally is to use Docker and Docker Compose. After installing them, it can be started
with one command:

```shell
docker compose -f <filename> up
```

where filename depends on desired environment (docker-compose.dev.yml or docker-compose.prod.yml).

‚ö†Ô∏è Before running the app, it is mandatory to provide environment variables in separate files (.env.dev or .env.prod)
according to the provided example.
